## About

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game, written in Python 3.

Each opponent can be played either by a human or the computer.
By convention, 'X' is always the first player, and 'O' the second player.

The computer follows a MinMax algorithm in which the whole tree is
computed.
This was my first project in Python, in which I practiced OOP for the
first time in this language.
Concerning implementation details, please refer to the class docstrings
in the script.

## Execution

In a shell, just run:

`python tictactoe.py`

No prior installation is required.

## Dependencies

None.
